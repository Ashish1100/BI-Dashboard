# Business Intelligence(BI)-Dashboard
A BI (business intelligence) dashboard is a visual interface that displays data and metrics in a way that is easy to understand and interact with.
Dashboards typically include a combination of charts, tables, and other visualizations that help users to quickly identify trends, patterns, and key performance indicators. They can be used to track sales, customer behavior, website traffic, and many other types of data. Dashboards can be accessed through a web browser or mobile device, and can be customized to meet the specific needs of an organization.
